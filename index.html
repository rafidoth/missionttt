                <p>This ML project aims to find the Myers Briggs personality of a person based on the types of posts
                    they put on social media. Myers Briggs Type Indicator is a personality identification system that
                    divides a person into one of 16 different personalities based on introversion, intuition, thinking,
                    and perceiving capabilities. The axis ranges from Introversion (I) to Extroversion (E), Intuition
                    (N) to Sensing (S), Thinking (T) to Feeling (F), and Judging (J) to Perceiving (P).</p>
